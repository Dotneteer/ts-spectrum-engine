These can be considered to be of three types: I) Binary operations, e.g. addition, where two numbers in floating-point form are added together to give one 'last value'. II) Unary operations, e.g. sin, where the 'last value' is changed to give the appropriate function result as a new 'last value'.

It is also called through the calculator when it simply duplicates the number at the top of the calculator stack, the 'last value', thereby extending the stack by five bytes.","13254":"THE 'STACK LITERALS' SUBROUTINE: This subroutine places on the calculator stack, as a 'last value', the floating-point number supplied to it as 2, 3, 4 or 5 literals. In each case, the first literal supplied is divided by Hex.40, and the integer quotient plus 1 determines whether 1, 2, 3 or 4 further literals will be taken from the source to form the mantissa of the number. Any unfilled bytes of the five bytes that go to form a 5-byte floating-point number are set to zero. The first literal is also used to determine the exponent, after reducing mod Hex.40, unless the remainder is zero, in which case the second literal is used, as it stands, without reducing mod Hex.40. In either case, Hex.50 is added to the literal, giving the augmented exponent byte, e (the true exponent e' plus Hex.80).

It finds the address of that pixel and plots it, taking account of the status of INVERSE and OVER held in the P-FLAG.","8907":"THE 'POINT' SUBROUTINE: This subroutine is called by the POINT function in SCANNING. It is entered with the co-ordinates of a pixel on the calculator stack, and returns a last value of 1 if that pixel is ink colour, and 0 if it is paper colour.","8967":"THE 'STK-TO-BC' SUBROUTINE: This subroutine loads two floating point numbers into the BC register pair.

It also obtains in DE the 'diagonal move' values (+/-1,+/-1) which are used in the line drawing subroutine of DRAW.","8980":"THE 'STK-TO-A' SUBROUTINE: This subroutine loads the A register with the floating point number held at the top of the calculator stack. The number must be in the range 00-FF.","8992":"THE 'CIRCLE' COMMAND ROUTINE: This routine draws an approximation to the circle with centre co-ordinates X and Y and radius Z. These numbers are rounded to the nearest integer before use. Thus Z must be less than 87.5, even when (X,Y) is in the centre of the screen. The method used is to draw a series of arcs approximated by straight lines. It is illustrated in the BASIC program in the appendix. The notation of that program is followed here. CIRCLE has four parts: 1)Tests the radius. If its modulus is less than 1, just plot X,Y; 2)Calls CD-PRMS-1 at 2470-24B6, which is used to set the initial parameters for both CIRCLE and DRAW; 3) Sets up the remaining parameters for CIRCLE, including the initial displacement for the first 'arc' (a straight line in fact); 4) Jumps into DRAW to use the arc-drawing loop at 2420-24FA.","9019":"2) 233B-2346 and the call to CD-PRMS1. 2*PI is stored in mem-5 and CD-PRMS1 is called. This subroutine stores in the B register the number of arcs required for the circle, viz. A=4*INT (PI*SQR Z/4)+4, hence 4, 8, 12 ..., up to a maximum of 32. It also stores in mem-0 to mem-4 the quantities 2*PI/A, SIN(PI/A), 0, COS (2*PI/A) and SIN (2*PI/A).","9031":"3) 2347-2381: the remaining parameters and the jump to DRAW. A test is made to see whether the initial 'arc' length is less than 1. If it is, a jump is made simply to plot X, Y. Otherwise, the parameters are set: X+Z and X-Z*SIN (PI/A) are stacked twice as start and end point, and copied to COORDS as well; zero and 2*Z*SIN (PI/A) are stored in mem-1 and mem-2 as initial increments, giving as first 'arc' the vertical straight line joining X+Z, y-Z*SIN (PI/A) and X+Z, Y+Z*SIN (PI/A). The arc-drawing loop of DRAW will ensure that all subsequent points remain on the same circle as these two points, with incremental angle 2*PI/A. But it is clear that these 2 points in fact subtend this angle at the point X+Z*(1-COS (PI/A)), Y not at X, Y. Hence the end points of each arc of the circle are displaced right by an amount 2*(1-COS (PI/A)), which is less than half a pixel, and rounds to one pixel at most.","9062":"Here sa denotes X+Z and sb denotes Y - Z*SIN (PI/A)","9090":"THE DRAW COMMAND ROUTINE: This routine is entered with the co-ordinates of a point X0, Y0, say, in COORDS. If only two parameters X, Y are given with the DRAW command, it draws an approximation to a straight line from the point X0, Y0 to X0+X, Y0+Y. If a third parameter G is given, it draws an approximation to a circular arc from X0, Y0 to X0+X, Y0+Y turning anti-clockwise through an angle G radians. The routine has four parts: 1) Just draws a line if only 2 parameters are given or if the diameter of the implied circle is less than 1; 2) Calls CD-PRMS1 at 247D-24B6 to set the first parameters; 3) Sets up the remaining parameters, including the initial displacements for the first arc; 4) Enters the arc-drawing loop and draws the arc as a series of smaller arcs approximated by straight lines, calling the line-drawing subroutine at 24B7-24FA as necessary.","9153":"2) Just calls CD-PRMS1. This subroutine saves in the B register the number of shorter arcs required for the complete arc, viz. A=4*INT (G'*SQR Z/8)+4, where G' = mod G, or 252 if this expression exceeds 252 (as can happen with a large chord and a small angle). So A is 4, 8, 12, ... , up to 252. The subroutine also stores in mem-0 to mem-4 the quantities G/A, SIN (G/2*A), 0, COS (G/A), SIN (G/A).","9156":"3) Sets up the rest of the parameters as follow. The stack will hold these 4 items, reading up to the top: X0+X and Y0+Y as end of last arc; then X0 and Y0 as beginning of first arc. Mem-0 will hold X0 and mem-5 Y0. Mem-1 and mem-2 will hold the initial displacements for the first arc, U and V; and mem-3 and mem-4 will hold COS (G/A) and SIN (G/A) for use in the arc-drawing loop.","9248":"4) The arc-drawing loop. This is entered at 2439 with the co-ordinates of the starting point on top of the stack, and the initial displacements for the first arc in mem-1 and mem-2. It uses simple trigonometry to ensure that all subsequent arcs will be drawn to points that lie on the same circle as the first two, subtending the same angle at the centre. It can be shown that if 2 points X1, Y1 and X2, Y2 lie on a circle and subtend an angle N at the centre, which is also the origin of co-ordinates, then X2 = X1*COS N - Y1*SIN N, and Y2 = X1*SIN N + Y1*COS N. But because the origin is here at the increments, say Un = Xn+1 - Xn and Vn = Yn+1 - Yn, thus achieving the desired result. The stack is shown below on the (n+1)th pass through the loop, as Xn and Yn are incremented by Un and Vn, after these are obtained from Un-1 and Vn-1. The 4 values on the top of the stack at 2425 are, in DRAW, reading upwards, X0+X, Y0+Y, Xn and Yn but to save space these are not shown until 2439. For the initial values in CIRCLE, see the end of CIRCLE, above. In CIRCLE too, the angle G must be taken to be 2*PI.","9341":"THE 'INITIAL PARAMETERS' SUBROUTINE: This subroutine is called by both CIRCLE and DRAW to set their initial parameters. It is called by CIRCLE with X, Y and the radius Z on the top of the stack, reading upwards. It is called by DRAW with its own X, Y, SIN (G/2) and Z, as defined in DRAW i. above, on the top of the stack. In what follows the stack is only shown from Z upwards. The subroutine returns in B the arc-count A as explained in both CIRCLE and DRAW above, and in mem-0 to mem-5 the quantities G/A, SIN (G/2*A), 0, COS (G/A), SIN (G/A) and G. For a circle, G must be taken to be equal to 2*PI.","9399":"THE LINE-DRAWING SUBROUTINE: This subroutine is called by DRAW to draw an approximation to a straight line from the point X0, Y0 held in COORDS to the point X0+X, Y0+Y, where the increments X and Y are on the top of the calculator stack. The subroutine was originally intended for the ZX80 and ZX81 8K ROM, and it is described in a BASIC program on page 121 of the ZX81 manual. It is also illustrated here in the Circle program in the appendix. The method is to intersperse as many horizontal or vertical steps as are needed among a basic set of diagonal steps, using an algorithm that spaces the horizontal or vertical steps as evenly as possible.","9420":"The algorithm starts here. The larger of ABS X and ABS Y, say H, is put into A and reduced to INT (H/2). The H - L horizontal or vertical steps and L diagonal steps are taken (where L is the smaller of ABS X and ABS Y) in this way: L is added to A; if A now equals or exceeds H, it is reduced by H and a diagonal step is taken; otherwise a horizontal or vertical step is taken.

Note that meanwhile the exchange registers H' and L' are used to hold COORDS.","9465":"Report B - Integer out of range","9467":"THE 'SCANNING' SUBROUTINE: This subroutine is used to produce an evaluation result of the 'next expression'. The result is returned as the 'last value' on the calculator stack. For a numerical result, the last value will be the actual floating point number. However, for a string result the last value will consist of a set of parameters. The first of the five bytes is unspecified, the second and third bytes hold the address of the start of the string and the fourth and fifth bytes hold the length of the string. When a next expression consists of only a single operand, e.g. ... A ..., ... RND ..., ... A$ (4, 3 TO 7) ... , then the last value is simply the value that is obtained from evaluating the operand. However when the next expression contains a function and an operand, e.g. ... CHR$ A..., ... NOT A ... , SIN 1 ..., the operation code of the function is stored on the machine stack until the last value of the operand has been calculated. This last value is then subjected to the appropriate operation to give a new last value. In the case of there being an arithmetic or logical operation to be performed, e.g. ... A+B ... , A*B ..., ... A=B ... , then both the last value of the first argument and the operation code have to be kept until the last value of the second argument has been found. Indeed the calculation of the last value of the second argument may also involve the storing of last values and operation codes whilst the calculation is being performed. It can therefore be shown that as a complex expression is evaluated, e.g. ... CHR$ (T+A - 26*INT ((T+A)/26)+65)..., a hierarchy of operations yet to be performed is built up until the point is reached from which it must be dismantled to produce the final last value. Each operation code has associated with it an appropriate priority code and operations of higher priority are always performed before those of lower priority. The subroutine begins with the A register being set to hold the first character of the expression and a starting priority marker - zero - being put on the machine stack.","9487":"Four subroutines follow; they are called by routines from the scanning function table.

In the extreme case, the carry ripples right back to the left of the number. When this subroutine is called during addition, this ripple means that a mantissa of 0.5 was shifted a full 32 places right, and the addend will now be set to zero; when called from MULTIPLICATION, it means that the exponent must be incremented, and this may result in overflow.","12303":"THE 'SUBTRACTION' OPERATION: (Offset 03 - see CALCULATE below: 'subtract') This subroutine simply changes the sign of the subtrahend and carried on into ADDITION.","12308":"THE 'ADDITION' OPERATION: (Offset 0F - see CALCULATE below: 'addition') The first of three major arithmetical subroutines, this subroutine carries out the floating-point addition of two numbers, each with a 4-byte mantissa and a 1-byte exponent. In these three subroutines, the two numbers at the top of the calculator stack are added/multiplied/divided to give one number at the top of the calculator stack, a 'last value'. HL points to the second number from the top, the augend/multiplier/dividend. DE points to the number at the top of the calculator stack, the addend/multiplicand/divisor. Afterwards HL points to the resultant 'last value' whose address can also be considered to be STKEND - 5. But the addition subroutine first tests whether the 2 numbers to be added are 'small integers'. If they are, it adds them quite simply in HL and BC, and puts the result directly on the stack.

Most functions treat it as zero, and it is printed as -1E-38, obtained by treating is as 'minus zero' in an illegitimate format.","12353":"The full ADDITION subroutine first calls PREP-ADD for each number, then gets the two numbers from the calculator stack and puts the one with the smaller exponent into the addend position. It then calls SHIFT-FP to shift the addend up to 32 decimal places right to line it up for addition. The actual addition is done in a few bytes, a single shift is made for carry (overflow to the left) if needed, the result is twos complemented if negative, and any arithmetic overflow is reported; otherwise the subroutine jumps to TEST-NORM to normalise the result and return it to the stack with the correct sign bit inserted into the second byte.","12457":"THE 'HL=HL*DE' SUBROUTINE: This subroutine is called by 'GET-HL*DE' and by 'MULTIPLICATION' to perform the 16-bit multiplication as stated.

If they are, it uses INT-FETCH to get them from the stack, HL=HL*DE to multiply them and INT-STORE to return the result to the stack.

Next fetches the two numbers from the calculator stack and divides their mantissa by means of the usual restoring division, trial subtracting the divisor from the dividend and restoring if there is carry, otherwise adding 1 to the quotient.

If I(x) is a 'short integer' the subroutine returns it in that form. It returns x if the exponent byte is A0 hex or greater (x has no significant non-integral part).
